In JavaScript, `let`, `const`, and `var` are used to declare variables, but they have different characteristics and scoping rules. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

### `var`

**What it is:**  
`var` is the oldest way to declare variables in JavaScript.

**Where it is used:**  
It is function-scoped or globally scoped if not declared inside a function.

**Why it is used:**  
Historically, `var` was the only way to declare variables, but it has some quirks that can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Hoisting:** Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means you can use the variable before it is declared.
- **Function-scoped:** If declared inside a function, it is local to that function; otherwise, it is global.
- **Re-declaration:** You can re-declare a variable declared with `var` without any errors.

```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined (hoisted)
var a = 5;
console.log(a); // 5

if (true) {
    var b = 10;
}
console.log(b); // 10 (function-scoped or globally scoped)
```

### `let`

**What it is:**  
`let` is a modern way to declare variables introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).

**Where it is used:**  
It is block-scoped, meaning it is only available within the block it is declared in.

**Why it is used:**  
It provides better scoping rules compared to `var`, avoiding some common pitfalls.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Block-scoped:** Only accessible within the block (e.g., `{}`) where it is declared.
- **No hoisting to the same extent as `var`:** The variable is hoisted but not initialized until the line of declaration.
- **No re-declaration in the same scope:** You cannot re-declare a variable with `let` in the same scope.

```javascript
if (true) {
    let c = 20;
    console.log(c); // 20
}
console.log(c); // ReferenceError: c is not defined

let d = 30;
let d = 40; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'd' has already been declared
```

### `const`

**What it is:**  
`const` is used to declare constants, introduced in ES6.

**Where it is used:**  
It is block-scoped, similar to `let`.

**Why it is used:**  
It ensures that the variable's value cannot be reassigned, providing immutability.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Block-scoped:** Only accessible within the block where it is declared.
- **Immutable bindings:** The value assigned to a `const` variable cannot be changed (though if the value is an object or array, the contents can still be modified).
- **Must be initialized:** You must assign a value when you declare a `const` variable.

```javascript
if (true) {
    const e = 50;
    console.log(e); // 50
    e = 60; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
}

const f = 70;
const f = 80; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'f' has already been declared

const g = { name: "John" };
g.name = "Jane"; // This is allowed
console.log(g.name); // Jane
```

### Summary

- Use `var` if you need function-scoped variables and are maintaining older code.
- Use `let` for variables that may need to be reassigned and are block-scoped.
- Use `const` for variables that should not be reassigned after their initial value is set and are block-scoped.

Choosing between `let` and `const` usually depends on whether you expect the variable to change value or not. In modern JavaScript development, `let` and `const` are preferred over `var`.
